# iOS Application
## SWUMap
Application that display map at Srinakharinwirot University

Me and my friends create this project because SWU already have iOS application but didn't have map to tell where the building and SWU OpenHouse use paper to guide student places this cause some student get confused where's the right building. So, this application will tell users where's the building, names, numbers, faculty and also most important place to known "Toilet". Users can communicating by using chat in-app (registering with email name and password).

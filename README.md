## SWUMap
Application that display map at Srinakarinwirot University

Me and my friends create this project because SWU already have iOS application but didn't have map to tell where the building and SWU OpenHouse use paper to guide student places this cause some student get confused where's the right building. So, this application will tell users where's the building, names, numbers, faculty and also most important place to known "Toilet". Users can communicating by using chat in-app (registering with email name and password).

- Using: Swift Storyboard (Runtime UI), UIKit, Cocoapods (Firebase Auth, Firebase RealtimeDB, Realm)
- Development Role: System Analyst
- Development Period: 2nd year in Computer for Communication at College of Social Communication Innovation, Srinakharinwirot University
